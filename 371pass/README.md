You should use this README to document things you did that you thing are clever and could get you marks, or things you couldn't get working and perhaps why. It is fully expected that a lot of students will not complete this coursework—it is designed to be challenging. The mark scheme is also designed to be fair—marks are awarded for everything you complete, with some given for the quality of the code you write.

All of the requirements mentioned in the coursework description have been implemented. The Item, Category and Wallet classes contain the necessary methods for instantiating, adding, updating and deleting specific instances. Also, the program arguments are properly handled, all of the exceptions being caught when needed.
